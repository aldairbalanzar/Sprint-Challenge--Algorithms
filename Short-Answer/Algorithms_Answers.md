#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
our loop only runs while our condition is true and with the way our condition is set up, we get closer and closer to it with each iteration

b)
there are two loops and one of them is nested, therefore squaring the work

c)
The recursion relies on the input, it determines how many computations will happen until we reach our base case
## Exercise II
initiate my function to take in parameter of f (f = floor egg will be dropped from)
  within the function, have two if statements
  a variable to check if egg has been broken
  two conditions depending if egg has been broken
    1, if egg has not been broken, run the function again only this time f will be one more than the previous
    2, if egg is broken, return f because that is the floor it breaks from
